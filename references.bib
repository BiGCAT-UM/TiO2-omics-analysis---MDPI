@article{Circu2010,
abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products of normal metabolism and xenobiotic exposure, and depending on their concentration, ROS can be beneficial or harmful to cells and tissues. At physiological low levels, ROS function as "redox messengers" in intracellular signaling and regulation, whereas excess ROS induce oxidative modification of cellular macromolecules, inhibit protein function, and promote cell death. Additionally, various redox systems, such as the glutathione, thioredoxin, and pyridine nucleotide redox couples, participate in cell signaling and modulation of cell function, including apoptotic cell death. Cell apoptosis is initiated by extracellular and intracellular signals via two main pathways, the death receptor- and the mitochondria-mediated pathways. Various pathologies can result from oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling that is consequent to ROS increases and/or antioxidant decreases, disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis, and irreversible oxidative modifications of lipid, protein, or DNA. In this review, we focus on several key aspects of ROS and redox mechanisms in apoptotic signaling and highlight the gaps in knowledge and potential avenues for further investigation. A full understanding of the redox control of apoptotic initiation and execution could underpin the development of therapeutic interventions targeted at oxidative stress-associated disorders. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Redza-Dutordoir2016,
abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are short-lived and highly reactive molecules. The generation of ROS in cells exists in equilibrium with a variety of antioxidant defences. At low to modest doses, ROS are considered to be essential for regulation of normal physiological functions involved in development such as cell cycle progression and proliferation, differentiation, migration and cell death. ROS also play an important role in the immune system, maintenance of the redox balance and have been implicated in activation of various cellular signalling pathways. Excess cellular levels of ROS cause damage to proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, membranes and organelles, which can lead to activation of cell death processes such as apoptosis. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that is essential for the development and survival of multicellular organisms. These organisms often need to discard cells that are superfluous or potentially harmful, having accumulated mutations or become infected by pathogens. Apoptosis features a characteristic set of morphological and biochemical features whereby cells undergo a cascade of self-destruction. Thus, proper regulation of apoptosis is essential for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis. ROS play a central role in cell signalling as well as in regulation of the main pathways of apoptosis mediated by mitochondria, death receptors and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This review focuses on current understanding of the role of ROS in each of these three main pathways of apoptosis. The role of ROS in the complex interplay and crosstalk between these different signalling pathways remains to be further unravelled during the coming years.},

abstract = {Toxicogenomics (TGx) approaches are increasingly applied to gain insight into the possible toxicity mechanisms of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Omics data can be valuable to elucidate the mechanism of action of chemicals and to develop predictive models in toxicology. While vast amounts of transcriptomics data from ENM exposures have already been accumulated, a unified, easily accessible and reusable collection of transcriptomics data for ENMs is currently lacking. In an attempt to improve the FAIRness of already existing transcriptomics data for ENMs, we curated a collection of homogenized transcriptomics data from human, mouse and rat ENM exposures in vitro and in vivo including the physicochemical characteristics of the ENMs used in each study.},
